# MolecularSynth: Organic Molecule Synthesis Simulator

## Overview

MolecularSynth is an innovative application designed for students and professionals in organic chemistry. It allows users to simulate the synthesis of organic molecules, visualize reaction steps, and calculate intermediate and final products. The app provides suggestions for optimal reaction routes and reagent choices.

## Features

- **Organic Reactions Database**: Access a comprehensive collection of common organic reactions and add custom reactions.
- **Synthetic Route Simulator**: Input a starting molecule and a target product to receive suggested synthesis routes, ranked by efficiency, cost, or number of steps.
- **Molecular Structure Visualization**: View 2D and 3D representations of molecules and intermediates.
- **Molecular Property Calculations**: Calculate molecular mass, boiling point, reaction energy, and more.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Interactive interface for selecting reagents, reaction conditions, and viewing results.
- **Route Optimization**: Suggest shorter or cost-effective synthesis paths based on sustainability or reagent availability.

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML, CSS
